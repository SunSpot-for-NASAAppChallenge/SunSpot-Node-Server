# SunSpot-Node-Server
The code for a Node.js server for the SunSpot project.

### API Calls
This is currently not on a server, so there is no URL for it. However, the call requires a manditory parameter action.

Actions:
* retrieve - returns the JSON text for the EchoDot.
* get-details - returns the raw JSON object as it is stored on the server.
* [other actions may be added later]
